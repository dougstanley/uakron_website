Student Ethics and Other Policy Information
===========================================

University Policies
-------------------

Academic Dishonesty
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Students at The University of Akron are an essential part of the academic
community, and enjoy substantial freedom within the framework of the
educational objectives of the institution. The freedom necessary for learning
in a community so rich in diversity and achieving success toward our
educational objectives require high standards of academic integrity. Academic
dishonesty has no place in an institution of advanced learning. The University
community is governed by the policies and regulations contained with the
Student Code of Conduct available in the Office of Student Conduct,
(330) 972-7021.

The University of Akron considers academic integrity as essential part of
each student's personal and intellectual growth. Instances of academic
dishonesty are addressed consistently. All members of the community contribute
actively to building a strong reputation of academic excellence and integrity
at The University of Akron. It is each student's responsibility to know what
constitutes academic dishonesty and to seek clarification directly from the
instructor if necessary. Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not
limited to: 

* Submission of an assignment as the student's original work that is entirely
  or partly the work of another person. 

* Failure to appropriately cite references from published or unpublished works
  or print/non-print materials. 

* Unauthorized copying of an assignment in computer programming, or the
  unauthorized examination or view of the computer, specifically during
  examinations. 

* Possession and/or unauthorized use of tests, notes, books, calculators or
  formulas stored in calculators not authorized by the instructor during an
  examination. 

* Providing and/or receiving information from another student other than the
  instructor, by any verbal or written means. 

* Observing or assisting another student's work. 

* Violation of the procedures prescribed by the professor to protect the
  integrity of the examination. 

* Cooperation with a person involved in academic misconduct. 

* CUTTING AND PASTING FROM THE INTERNET, INCLUDING GRAPHICS, SCREEN CAPTURES,
  OR PREVIOUSLY EXISTING EXAMPLES OF ANY KIND. 

* Cheating of any kind will result in failure of the assignment/test and
  possibly the course. The student may also be subject to The University Policy
  on Academic Misconduct. 

A student who has been accused of academic dishonesty will be asked to meet
with the course instructor. The matter can be resolved informally at the
College level and/or an academic sanction can be imposed. If the student
opposes the decision, he/she may appeal to the College Dean. If the matter is
referred to the Office of Student Conduct, an informal meeting will occur and,
if substantial evidence exists, the office has the authority to take formal
action against the student including, but not limited to, suspension or
dismissal from the University. A more detailed discussion of these procedures
can be found in the Student Code of Conduct.


ADA Statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any student who has a disability that substantially limits learning in a
higher education setting may contact the office of Accessibility (formerly
known as Services for Students with Disabilities) for information regarding
their eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The office is located in
Simmons Hall #105 and the office telephone number is 972-7928 (Voice) or
972-5764 (TDD). 


Adding Courses-Registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A student must register for a course before the end of the fifth day of a fall
or spring term or the second day of a summer session. Additions to the
student's official schedule may be made after that date, but before the 15th
calendar day, only with the permission of the student's adviser, instructor,
and dean or dean's designate. Students who have not registered and paid by
this deadline may not attend classes to receive credit for the course.

This deadline applies to all regular 15-week courses offered in the fall and
spring semesters as well as to regular courses in Summer I and II. For all
other courses, such as those in intersession or those, which have flexibly
scheduled, courses must be added, with appropriate permission, by the date
when 20% of the course has been completed.


Withdrawal Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A student may withdrawal from a course without an advisor's or course
instructor's signature through the 15th day of a semester or comparable dates
during summer sessions, intersession, etc. After the 15th day of a semester,
and up to the midpoint of a semester, a student may withdraw from a course
with the signature of the student's adviser.

After the midpoint of a semester, a student may have the signature of both the
course instructor and the adviser. Such authorization must be dated and
processed through the office of the Registrar no later than the last day of
the 12th week of classes or comparable dates during summer session,
intersession, etc.

An approved withdrawal after the 15th day of the term will be indicated on the
University official academic record by a "WD." A student who leaves a course
without going through the withdrawal procedure will be given an "F" in the
course.


Diversity
~~~~~~~~~

Together, we maintain an intellectual culture that is accessible, disciplined,
free, safe, and committed to excellence. By our behavior with one another we
endorse a cultural of diversity, celebrating the uniqueness of the individual
and developing our understanding and tolerance of differences in gender,
ethnicity, age, spiritual belief, sexual orientation, and physical and mental
potential. We take responsibilities for sustaining a caring culture, nurturing
growth and fulfillment in one another and in the larger communities of which
we are a part. We insist on a culture of civility, united in our rejections of
violence, coercion, deceit, or terrorism. We work to increase collaboration,
cooperation, and consensus within rational dialogue characterized by mutual
respect and consideration.

This is a responsible culture. We expect each member of our community to carry
out responsibly his or her duties for preserving the integrity, quality, and
decency of our environment and our discourse.

In order to accomplish the above-mentioned expectations and responsibilities,
everyone must engage in certain specific behaviors. Inside the classroom, the
students are expected to respect the sanctity of the teaching/learning process
by expressing respect for the faculty member as the organizer and guide
through this learning experience, as well as for fellow students. Disruptive,
disrespectful, discriminatory, harassing, violent and/or threatening behavior
is explicitly prohibited. Students are expected to be responsible for their
own learning and, in return, can expect responsible teaching from the faculty
member.


Incompletes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Incompletes indicate that the student has done passing work but that some part
of the work is, for good and acceptable reason, not complete at the end of the
term. Failure to make up the omitted work satisfactorily by the end of the
following term, not including summer sessions, converts the "I" to an "F."
When the work is satisfactorily completed within the allotted time the "I" is
converted to whatever grade the student has earned. 


In-Progresses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In-progresses indicate that the student has not completed the scheduled course
work during the term because the nature of the course does not permit
completion within a single term, such as work toward a thesis.


University Closing Policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The president, or designee, upon the recommendation of the Director of Public
Safety and Chief of Police, will determine when conditions--such as severe
weather or a state of emergency--necessitate closing the entire University or
canceling classes at the main campus and/or Wayne College in Orrville. 

The Director of Public Safety and Chief of Police will promptly notify other
designated University officials and members of the Department of University
Communications, who will contact area media. University colleges/departments
are encouraged to establish a method for communicating the closing decisions
to department personnel. Closing information will be announced as early and as
simply as possible to avoid confusion. Cancellation of classes and closure
announcements will be made as early as possible in the day and will clearly
state the affected campus (es). Call 972-SNOW or 972-6238 (TDD/Voice) for
updated information.

For information concerning cancellation of campus based classes and web-based
courses (those closing and cancellations that only affect your particular
scheduled class), see course policies.


Course Policies 
----------------

Absences
~~~~~~~~

There may be 5 points deducted for every absence. If it is necessary to miss
class for any reason, contact the instructor prior to the class session.
Tests and Labs are to be taken on time. If you are unable to take a test or do
a Lab during the regularly scheduled class time, you must contact the
instructor before the test and have a valid excuse. There are NO make-up tests
or Labs!


Course Concerns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have any concerns, regarding anything related to the course, please
contact the instructor. 

Deadlines
~~~~~~~~~

It is your responsibility to meet all of the deadlines for every class
session, assignments, and assignment task. Assignments will be given
deadlines--ANY assignments not turned in on the designated due dates and
times, will be considered late and counted as a zero(0) for that assignment.


Ethics
~~~~~~

Students are expected to display ethical behavior at all times. Cheating,
plagiarism, etc., will not be tolerated. The consequences of dishonest
behavior will be commensurate with the activity to include, but not be limited
to, an 'F' for the class, dialogue with administrators, and dismissal from the
college.


Grades
~~~~~~

Student grades will be submitted to the appropriate department at the end of
the semester (due dates for grades are determined by The University of Akron).
Students can obtain their grades via the automated telephone grade inquiry
line (258-2300 as listed in the schedule of classes), or via the Internet/Web
from The University of Akron's Home Page (http://www.uakron.edu). Grades
cannot be obtained from your instructor.

.. note:: Students who names do not appear on the University's official class
    roster by the tenth day of the semester will not be permitted to
    participate (participate in discussions, turn in homework, or receive
    credit). 

.. note:: All cell phones, pagers, and other devices must be set to vibrate or
    turned off during class. The sound on laptop or other computers must be
    turned off during class. Students are expected to not interrupt when
    another person is talking and to not disrupt the class by talking to
    others when someone is presenting.  Students are not to use computers,
    PDAs, etc. for any purpose other than authorized class-related activities
    when class is in session.


Misc
~~~~

**STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO FOLLOW ALL LAB, DEPARTMENTAL, COLLEGE, AND
UNIVERSITY RULES AND REGULATIONS AND ALL LAWS.** It is the student's
responsibility to know, understand, and obey these rules, regulations, and
laws. Some of them include:

* All course prerequisites must be met. 

* No food or drinks in the labs. 

* Only registered students may attend class (no friends or children). 

* No plagiarism. 

* The University of Akron is committed to maintaining an environment free of
  sexual and other forms of harassment and discrimination. 


Students may not alter UA computers, including lab computers, by changing the
desktop, installing software not authorized by the instructor, deleting or
shutting down software or files placed there by a representative of the
University, or any other form of alteration or destruction. Unauthorized
alteration of a computer may result in failure of the course, dismissal from
the Cisco Networking Academy and/or referral to student judicial review for
further disciplinary action.

**PRINTING:** Printing of material unrelated to the course or printing of
material that should be printed in a homework lab or at home is not permitted
in the classroom labs. This is true regardless of whether a class is in
session or not. This will result in confiscation of the material printed and
may result in additional disciplinary action.


.. note:: This Syllabus is subject to change at the instructor's discretion.
